Drafts allows you to share draft entries and/or pages with collaborators without having to create a User for them.

For example, you can create a draft `About Us` page and give folks a URL to view that draft content.

Please note:
* this only appears if content is **not** published (i.e. a draft)
* these URLs are public, anyone can view them.
* once the content is published, visiting that URL redirects to the actual content
